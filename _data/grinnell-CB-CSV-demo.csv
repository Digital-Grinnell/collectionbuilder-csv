By examining roles of transcendence in the Eastern and Western religions, I explore the avenue of conflict between modern science and the Abrahamic faiths in particular. Further, I propose that science and religion are both forms of myth, but that science as myth proves problematic because it does not appear to fulfill a myth, but that science as myth proves problematic because it does not appear to fulfill a pedagogical role. I suggest that the explicit development of this function of scientific myth could allow for reconciliation between the two fields and bring us to a deeper understanding of what it means to be in the world.",Baumann Essay Collection,,Frederick Baumann Essay Prize (2009), Katherine Lee (Class of 2009),,,,Grinnell College,dg_1741021342,pdf,pdf,eng,pdf,,,,https://dgobjects.blob.core.windows.net/objs/dg_1741021342_OBJ.pdf,https://dgobjects.blob.core.windows.net/smalls/dg_1741021342_OBJ_SMALL.jpg,https://dgobjects.blob.core.windows.net/thumbs/dg_1741021342_OBJ_TN.jpg,,,,,,,,"Copyright to this work is held by the author(s), in accordance with United States copyright law (USC 17).
